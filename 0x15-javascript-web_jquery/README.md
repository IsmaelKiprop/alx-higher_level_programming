# JavaScript Web jQuery

This repository contains JavaScript scripts for web development using jQuery. Each script fulfills specific tasks related to DOM manipulation, event handling, and API requests.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following:

- A web browser with JavaScript enabled.
- Internet access to fetch data from external APIs.
- For some scripts, you need to include the jQuery library in your HTML file. You can use the following CDN link:

  ```html
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"></script>

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each script is numbered according to the task it fulfills.
- HTML files (`*.html`) are provided to test the scripts in a web browser.
- JavaScript files (`*-script.js`) contain the script implementations.
- The `README.md` file provides instructions for each task and additional information.

## Usage

To use the scripts:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-higher_level_programming.git
